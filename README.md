## Dataset
In this project, we use the 140k-real-and-fake-faces dataset sourced from https//www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces. The real images come from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia [\cite{ffhq2019}](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset), and the remaining half was sampled from the 1 Million fake faces generated by StyleGAN [\cite{karras2019stylebasedgeneratorarchitecturegenerative}](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) and provided by Bojan on kaggle. The images contained in it are of size 256x256 pixels with color channels RGB, depicting faces at their center.

## Project Steps
- **Custom Model**: CNN with custom architecture
- **Benchmark Model 1**: ResNet-50
- **Benchmark Model 2**: EfficientNet
- **Data Augmentation**: flipping, rotating, color changes, Gaussian blur
- **Grad-CAM**: explainability and finding key facial features
